# Overall
This project includes a web-application for a Eurovision Fanclub, developed using Flask and PostgreSQL 
for the Databases and Informations Systems course at UCPH 2023. For the frontend CSS styling, we use Bootstrap.

# Setup

## Requirements
### Prerequisites 
* Make sure to have postgreSQL installed and working with psql in the command line

### Installing requirements
Make sure the the modules specified in requirements.txt are installed. To do that run:

>$ pip install -r requirements.txt

It is recomended to install the requirements in a virtual environments. See https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/ 
for further documentation on virtual environments. 

## Initializing the database
1. Navigate to app/database.ini and configure your database with the proper settings. Remember to enter your password in database.ini
2. To load data into the database, navigate to the db_init directory and run schema.sql 
(Note that schema.sql will drop the existing schema 's' if a such exists)

Side note: In db_init clean.py is used to re-generate some of the .sql files from the dataset contestants.csv
The necessary sql has already been generated, and hence it should not be necessary to re-run clean.py

### Dataset used
The dataset used in the web application is downloaded from https://github.com/Spijkervet/eurovision-dataset/releases. 
The repository contains information about winners, placings and distibution of point from 1956-2019. 

Our database is built from the contestants.csv. In order to impliment meaningfull features such as allowing users 
to vote for their favourite song in the upcoming contest, the web server's historical setting is somewhere in april 2019,
before the show in Tel Aviv of that year.
